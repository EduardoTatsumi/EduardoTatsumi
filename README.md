- 👋 Hi, I’m @EduardoTatsumi! I am a Brasilian international student in Japan. I am on my senior year, pursuing a degree in Applied Physics Engineering, and minoring in Data Science.
- 👀 I’m interested in hardware, microcontrollers, control engineering, and data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying about motor control. More specific Brushless DC Motor Control through PWM.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects to further develop myself in my areas of interest.
